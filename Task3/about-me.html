			<p>My name is Petar, I am 20 years old. My hometown is Veliko Tarnovo but currently I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. I'm a cat.</p>
			<p>I finished my highschool degree in the Oldcapital highschool of economics and currently I am studying in Sofia University "St.Kliment Ohridski" with Informatics, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
			<p>Currently I don't have a job but mainly that's the reason why I signed up for the IT Talents courses. And also I wanted to keep myself busy with daily homeworks and new knowledge.</p>
			<p>Overall I'm a sports person and I always try to stay physically active. My biggest love is freestyle skiing. Sadly, a sport which isn't that developed in Bulgaria, but slowly we are getting there.</p>
